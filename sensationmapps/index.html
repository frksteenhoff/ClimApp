				<h2>Background Information</h2>
				<p>Thermal climate stress affects health and productivity for millions of European workers. Sudden changes in the thermal environment (heat waves or cold spells) are also major health challenges for the elderly and other vulnerable populations, increasing mortality and morbidity. The consequences of thermal stress are dependent not only on climate factors, but also on individual human physiology and thermoregulation capacity. For warning and preparation purposes, climate services can provide information on current and upcoming environmental conditions, but such weather forecasts will be much more valuable for individuals facing adverse weather conditions if combined with individual characteristics and translated into optimized adaptation strategies that can be provided and implemented immediately.

					The app uses your personal information (height, weight, age, gender) to calculate personalized coping strategies against thermal climate stress.

					Within the next year the app will regularly be updated with new thermal models along with optimization of the current content.
